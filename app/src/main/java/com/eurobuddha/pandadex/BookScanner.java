/**
 * The bounded V5 book scan — TWO commands total (Limit fired ten):
 *
 *   1. coins simplestate:true order:desc depth:<SCAN_DEPTH> address:<V5>   — the book
 *   2. coins relevant:true address:<V5>                                    — ownership belt
 *
 * SCAN_DEPTH sits under the node's ~1024-block visibility trim and above EXPIRY_BLOCKS, so
 * the scan sees every live order: GTC renewal keeps
 * every live order coin younger than expiry, and anything older is dead (expiry-sweepable)
 * anyway. Bounded because the upstream node's 256KB Binder overflow is an uncatchable
 * app-kill (HARD upstream-node constraint).
 *
 * The `truncated` flag distinguishes transport failure from a genuinely empty book so the
 * caller keeps its last-good view (Limit's stale-empty lesson).
